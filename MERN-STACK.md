## What is the MERN Stack?
A stack is the combination of technologies used to create a web application. Any web application will be made using multiple technologies (frameworks, libraries, databases etc).
The MERN stack is a JavaScript stack that’s designed to make the development process smoother. MERN includes four open-source components: MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js. These components provide an end-to-end framework for developers to work in. 

##A Closer Look at MERN Stack Components:

####1. MongoDB: A cross-platform document database:
MongoDB is a NoSQL (non-relational) document-oriented database.
While conventional relational databases have a typical schema design based on columns and tables, MongoDB is schema-less. Data is stored in flexible documents with a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)-based query language. The content, size, and number of fields in the documents can differ from one to the next. This means that the data structure to be changed over time.
MongoDB is known for being flexible and easy to scale.

#####Why use MongoDB?
* **Fast –** Being a document-oriented database, easy to index documents. Therefore a faster response.
* **Scalability –** Large data can be handled by dividing it into several machines.
* **Use of JavaScript –** MongoDB uses JavaScript which is the biggest advantage.
* **Schema Less –** Any type of data in a separate document.
* **Data stored in the form of JSON –**Objects, Object Members, Arrays, Values and Strings.JSON syntax is very easy to use.JSON has a wide range of browser compatibility.
* **Sharing Data:** Data of any size and type(video, audio) can be shared easily.
* **Simple Environment Setup –** Its really simple to set up MongoDB.
* **Flexible Document Model –** MongoDB supports document-model(tables, schemas, coloumns & SQL) which is faster and easier.

#### 2. Express: A back-end web application framework:
Express is a web application framework for Node.js, another MERN component. Instead of writing full web server code by hand on Node.js directly, developers use Express to simplify the task of writing server code. There’s no need to repeat the same code over and over, as you would with the Node.js HTTP module.
The Express framework is designed for building robust web applications and APIs. It’s known for its fast speed and minimalist structure, with many features available as plugins.

##### Why use Express?
* Asynchronous and Single-threaded.
* Effecient, fast & scalable
* Has the biggest community for Node.js
* Express promotes code reusability with its built-in router.
* Robust API

#### 3. React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces:
React was originally created by a software engineer at Facebook, and was later open-sourced. It is maintained by Facebook, as well as a community of development companies and individual developers.
The React library can be used for creating views rendered in HTML. React views are declarative. This means that developers don’t have to worry about managing the effects of changes in the view’s state (the object that determines how components behave) or changes in the data.
Instead of relying on templates to automate the creation of repetitive HTML or DOM (Document Object Model) elements, React uses a full-featured programming language (JavaScript) to construct repetitive or conditional DOM elements.
With React, the same code can run on both the server and the browser.

##### Why use React?
* **Virtual DOM –** A virtual DOM object is a representation of a DOM object. Virtual DOM is actually a copy of the original DOM. Any modification in the web application causes the entire UI to re-render the virtual DOM. Then the difference between the original DOM and this virtual DOM is compared and the changes are made accordingly to the original DOM.
* **JSX –** Stands for JavaScript XML. It is an HTML/XML JavaScript Extension which is used in React. Makes it easier and simpler to write React components.
* **Components –** ReactJS supports Components. Components are the building blocks of UI wherein each component has a logic and contributes to the overall UI. These components also promote code reusability and make the overall web application easier to understand.
* **High Performance –** Features like Virtual DOM, JSX and Components makes it much faster than the rest of the frameworks out there.
* **Developing Android/Ios Apps –** With React Native you can easily code Android-based or IOS-Based apps with just the knowledge of JavaScript and ReactJS.

#### 4. Node.js: A cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment:
Node.js was initially built for Google Chrome, and later open-sourced by Google in 2008. It is built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine. It’s designed to build scalable network applications, and can execute JavaScript code outside of a browser.
Node.js works without an enclosing HTML page, instead using its own module system based on CommonJS, to put together multiple JavaScript files.

##### Why use Node.JS?
* **Open source JavaScript Runtime Environemnt**
* **Single threading –** Follows a single threaded model.
* **Data Streaming**
* **Fast –** Built on Google Chrome’s JavaScript Engine, Node.js has a fast code execution.
* **Highly Scalable**


## The Benefits of the MERN Stack:
The main advantage for developers using the MERN stack is that every line of code is written in JavaScript. This is a programming language that’s used everywhere, both for client-side code and server-side code. With one language across tiers, there’s no need for context switching.
For tech stack with multiple programming languages, developers have to figure out how to interface them together. With the JavaScript stack, developers only need to be proficient in JavaScript and JSON.
Overall, using the MERN stack enables developers to build highly efficient web applications.
