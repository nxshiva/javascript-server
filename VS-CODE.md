5 Features of VS-CODE:

1. Visual Studio Code CLI:
Visual Studio Code comes with an inbuilt Command Line Interface. Once you've installed Visual Studio Code, and have it open, press ⇧⌘P to open the command palette for Mac, or just ⌘P and the press > button.
2. Git Integration:
Sometimes using Git can be fun or hard, but Visual Studio Code comes with integrated Git that allows for Adding, Committing, Pulling and Pushing Changes to a remote Git repository using a simple GUI.
3. Debugging:
Visual Studio Code has a rich API for enabling debugging tools.Debugging is a large topic, and is usually language/stack specific. Depending on the language you are using, there are available plugins that enable support for debugging, and you'll be able to use breakpoints to debug your code when developing.
4. Live Share:
Visual Studio Code Live Share is a feature that enables you to share your VS Code instance, and allow someone remote to control and run other things such as debuggers.
Live Share is published as a plugin, and is currently in Preview.
All that is required is for you to install the plugin, and the status bar will enable you share any working session by getting a link, once you are signed in.
5. Integrated Terminal:
Most of the time when running code, there's usually a terminal open either to the side, or somewhere in your machine.
Visual Studio Code comes with an Integrated Terminal accessible through View > Integrated Terminal, and configurable through the settings: "terminal.external.osxExec": "iTerm.app",. The terminal usually opens by default in the workspace you are in, and can also have split views.
